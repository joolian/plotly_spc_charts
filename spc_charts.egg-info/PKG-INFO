# Plotly charts for statistical process control

## Shewart Average and Range Chart
Creates an interactive Average and Range chart using Plotly.  
Subgroups are classed as out of control if they are greater than the upper control limit or less than the lower control limit.  
Each subgroup can be labelled and the labels will be shown on the chart when the mouse pointer is near the marker.  
The control limits can be calculated from a set of data and the chart plotted.  
New data can be plotted using the calculated control limits.  
The chart can be saved as PNG, JPEG, WebP, SVG and PDF.  
The control limits can be saved to JSON, and  loaded from JSON.  
The control limits can be set and retrieved as a dictionary.  
The subgroup labels, averages, ranges and status (in or out of control) can be retrieved as a pandas Dataframe.

For an example of usage see: [XbarR_example.ipynb](https://github.com/joolian/plotly_spc_charts/blob/main/examples/XbarR/XbarR_example.ipynb)

### Calculation of control limits
Calculations use the method given in: <em>Wheeler, D.J. and Chambers, D.S. (1992) Understanding statistical process control. SPC Press, Incorporated, p. 44.</em>  

$UCL_{\bar{X}} = \bar{\bar{X}} + A_{2}\bar{R}$  
  
$LCL_{\bar{X}} = \bar{\bar{X}} - A_{2}\bar{R}$  

$CL_{bar{X}} = \bar{\bar{X}}
  
$UCL_{R} = D_{4}\bar{R}$  
  
$CL_{R} = \bar{R}$  
  
$LCL_{R} = D_{3}\bar{R}$

Where:

$\bar{\bar{X}}$ is the average of all the values in the subgroups.  
$\bar{R}$ is the average of the subgroup ranges.  
$A_{2}$ is the value of the constant corresponding to the subgroup size.  
$D_{3}$ is the value of the constant corresponding to the subgroup size.  
$D_{4}$ is the value of the constant corresponding to the subgroup size.

## Shewart Individual and Moving Range Chart
Creates an interactive individual Moving Range chart using Plotly.  
Individual values and moving ranges are classed as out of control if they are greater than the upper control limit or less than the lower control limit.  
Each value can be labelled and the labels will be shown on the chart when the mouse pointer is near the marker.  
The control limits can be calculated from a set of data and the chart plotted.  
New data can be plotted using the calculated control limits.  
The chart can be saved as PNG, JPEG, WebP, SVG and PDF.  
The control limits can be saved to JSON, and  loaded from JSON.  
The control limits can be set and retrieved as a dictionary.  
The labels, individual values, moving ranges and status (in or out of control) can be retrieved as a pandas Dataframe.

For an example of usage see: [IndividualMR_example.ipynb](https://github.com/joolian/plotly_spc_charts/blob/main/examples/IndividualMR/IndividualMR_example.ipynb)

### Calculation of control limits
Calculations use the method given in: <em>Wheeler, D.J. and Chambers, D.S. (1992) Understanding statistical process control. SPC Press, Incorporated, pp. 48-49.</em>  

$UNPL_{X} = \bar{X} + \Large \frac{3\bar{mR}}{d_{2}}$

$LNPL_{X} = \bar{\bar{X}} - \Large \frac{3\bar{mR}}{d_{2}}$

$CL_{X} = \bar{X}$

$UCL_{R} = D_{4}\bar{mR}$  

$CL_{R} = \bar{mR}$  

Where:  

$\bar{X}$ is the average of the individual values.

$\bar{mR}$ is the average of the moving ranges. 

$d_{2}$ is the value of the constant corresponding to n=2.  

$D_{4}$ is the value of the constant corresponding to n=2.  

 ## Run Chart
Creates an interactive run chart using Plotly.  
Each value can be labelled and the labels will be shown on the chart when the mouse pointer is near the marker.  
The chart can be saved as PNG, JPEG, WebP, SVG and PDF.  
The value of the median can be retrieved.  

For an example of usage see: [Run_example.ipynb](https://github.com/joolian/plotly_spc_charts/blob/main/examples/Run/Run_example.ipynb)

## TODO
Allow the use of Western Electric rules.  
See: ,<em>[ Western Electric Company, Statistical Quality Control Handbook., Indianapolis, Indiana: Western Electric Co](https://www.westernelectric.com/library#technical)</em>

Add np-chart, p-chart, c-chart and u-chart, EWMA-chart, CUSUM-chart, pareto-chart and multi-variate charts.
